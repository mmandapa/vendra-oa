# Vendra Quote Parser (SET UP INSTRUCTIONS IN SETUP.MD)

## How Different Quote Formats Are Handled

The parser implements a multi-layered extraction approach with several specialized parsers:

**ComprehensivePDFParser**: The main entry point that orchestrates multiple extraction methods. It automatically detects CID font encoding issues and reorders extraction methods accordingly - prioritizing OCR for problematic PDFs.

**Multi-Format PDF Processing**: Uses pdfplumber for table-based documents, PyMuPDF for text-based documents, and OCR (Tesseract) for scanned images. Each method is tried in sequence until a successful extraction occurs.

**Dynamic OCR Parser**: A sophisticated OCR-based parser that makes no assumptions about structure. It uses multiple OCR approaches (direct PDF extraction, enhanced OCR with custom settings, and external tools) and chooses the best result based on quality scoring.

**Invoice2Data Parser**: Leverages the invoice2data library for structured invoice/quote extraction with template matching capabilities.

**Adaptive Parser**: Implements robust pattern matching with fallback strategies, including domain-specific knowledge for manufacturing components.

## Assumptions and Fallbacks Used

**Core Assumptions**:
- PDFs contain extractable text (either native or via OCR)
- Quotes have some structured pricing data (quantities, unit prices, totals)
- Line items have descriptions that can be identified from surrounding text
- Currency symbols or codes are present in the document

**Fallback Strategies**:
- **Multiple Extraction Methods**: If one parser fails, automatically tries the next (invoice2data → multi-format → OCR)
- **CID Issue Detection**: Automatically detects and handles PDFs with font encoding problems by prioritizing OCR
- **Quality Scoring**: Each extraction result is scored based on number of line items, total cost, and data completeness
- **Pattern Degradation**: Falls back to simpler regex patterns if complex patterns fail
- **Noise Filtering**: Removes non-inventory content like addresses, phone numbers, and metadata
- **Currency Detection**: Automatically detects currency from text and applies appropriate formatting

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful handling of malformed PDFs with empty result structures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging extraction issues
- Validation of extracted data before returning results
- Default values for missing quantities (defaults to 1) and invalid prices (defaults to 0.00)

## Ideas for Improving Accuracy and Reliability

**Enhanced OCR Capabilities**:
- Implement table structure detection for complex layouts
- Add support for handwritten text recognition
- Improve OCR accuracy with custom training data for manufacturing documents

**Machine Learning Integration**:
- Train custom models on historical quote data to improve line item classification
- Implement confidence scoring for all extracted fields
- Use NLP techniques to better understand context and relationships between data

**Template-Based Processing**:
- Create format-specific templates for common supplier quote layouts
- Implement template matching to automatically detect quote format
- Build a template library that can be easily extended for new suppliers

**Validation and Quality Assurance**:
- Add business logic validation (e.g., total should equal sum of line items)
- Implement cross-reference checking between different extraction methods
- Create a manual review interface for uncertain extractions

**Performance and Scalability**:
- Parallel processing for multiple PDFs
- Caching of common patterns and extraction results
- Streaming processing for large documents
- Memory optimization for handling large quote files

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Interactive correction interface for manual adjustments
- Preview mode showing extraction confidence levels
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Export to various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
