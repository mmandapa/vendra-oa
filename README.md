# Vendra Quote Parser

## How Different Quote Formats Are Handled

The parser employs a multi-layered approach to handle various quote formats:

**Multi-Format PDF Processing**: Uses multiple libraries (pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, OCR) to extract text from different PDF types - table-based documents, text-based documents, and scanned images.

**Adaptive Pattern Matching**: Implements comprehensive regex patterns that detect various price formats ($1,234.56, 1,234.56 €, 1234.56), quantity indicators (Qty: 12, 5 pieces, 3 units), and line item structures.

**Intelligent Content Filtering**: Filters out non-inventory content like phone numbers, addresses, and metadata while preserving relevant line items using domain-specific patterns for manufacturing components.

**Dynamic Line Item Discovery**: Uses machine learning-based classification to identify line items from unstructured text, with confidence scoring to determine if text represents actual inventory items.

## Assumptions and Fallbacks Used

**Core Assumptions**:
- Quotes contain structured or semi-structured pricing data
- Prices are in decimal format with currency symbols
- Quantities are whole numbers or simple fractions
- Line items have descriptions, quantities, and unit prices

**Fallback Strategies**:
- **Missing Quantity**: Defaults to quantity of 1 if not detected
- **Invalid Prices**: Sets price to 0.00 and logs warnings
- **No Line Items**: Creates basic "TOTAL" line item with extracted summary data
- **Multiple Extraction Methods**: If one method fails, tries alternative approaches (pdfplumber → PyMuPDF → OCR)
- **Pattern Degradation**: Falls back to simpler patterns if complex regex fails
- **Domain Knowledge**: Uses manufacturing-specific keywords and patterns when general extraction fails

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful handling of malformed PDFs with empty result structures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging extraction issues
- Validation of extracted data before returning results

## Ideas for Improving Accuracy and Reliability

**Machine Learning Enhancements**:
- Train custom models on historical quote data to improve line item classification
- Implement confidence scoring for all extracted fields
- Use NLP techniques to better understand context and relationships between data

**Template-Based Processing**:
- Create format-specific templates for common supplier quote layouts
- Implement template matching to automatically detect quote format
- Build a template library that can be easily extended for new suppliers

**Advanced OCR Improvements**:
- Implement table structure detection for complex layouts
- Use computer vision to identify and extract data from images
- Add support for handwritten text recognition

**Validation and Quality Assurance**:
- Add business logic validation (e.g., total should equal sum of line items)
- Implement cross-reference checking between different extraction methods
- Create a manual review interface for uncertain extractions

**Performance and Scalability**:
- Parallel processing for multiple PDFs
- Caching of common patterns and extraction results
- Streaming processing for large documents
- Memory optimization for handling large quote files

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Interactive correction interface for manual adjustments
- Preview mode showing extraction confidence levels
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Export to various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
